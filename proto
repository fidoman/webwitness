1. Cluster registration (use SSL only)
> name
< id, key, hmacalg

1.1. Update cluster key
> name, id *key
< [newkey, hmacalg] key

Registration should expire after 10 days of last quorum activity.

2. Node registration
> name, id, nodename *key
< [nodekey] key

3. Keep-alive
> name, id, nodename *key
< list name, state, extended data availability (list of classes - pairs name, latest timestamp or None)

In return to keepalive request server returns configuration version and changes since previous keep-alive


4. Extended data (sent by node if it reply to keep-alive saying that its resource data is unavailable)
> name, id, nodename *key, class name, value
(timestamp is set by server)
reply is same as for keep-alive

4. Extended data request
> name, id, nodename *key, class name

* encrypted hash
[] encrypted data

----
Odd number of quorums is preffered
Each node carries quorum
Additionaly independet quorums are deployed
Each node must be configured identically
"Force quorum" may be achived with removal of inaccessible quorums from configuration

----
Adaptive witness
Align keep-alive query frequency and node unavailability time-out with workload
Weekly loaded cluster will generate less traffic and longer fail-over time (DNS or other)
and high loaded is checked frequentrly and optimized to quick failover with higher costs
5 minutes for non-interactive applications (e-mail, news)
1 minute for weekly interactive (instant messaging)
15 seconds for on-line applications (web)
3 seconds for telephony, video etc.
